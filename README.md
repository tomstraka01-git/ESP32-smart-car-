ESP32 Smart Car (WiFi Controlled)

This project is a **WiFi-controlled smart car** using an **ESP32**.
You control the car from your **phone or computer browser**.
It also shows the **battery voltage**, **battery percentage**, and
plays a **buzzer warning when the battery is low**.



---

##  Features

-  Control the car using WiFi (no app needed!)
-  Live battery voltage and percentage
-  Low battery warning with buzzer
-  Forward, Backward, Left, Right


---

##  How It Works 

1. The **ESP32 creates its own WiFi network**
2. You connect your phone to that WiFi
3. You open a web page
4. Buttons on the page control the motors
5. The ESP32 checks the battery level
6. If battery is low, the buzzer turns ON

##  Battery Monitoring

- Uses a **voltage divider**
- Reads voltage from ADC pin `GPIO 34`
- Shows:
  - Battery Voltage (V)
  - Battery Percentage (%)
- Buzzer turns ON when battery ≤ **10%**
